# React compoment for Geoapify Geocoder Autocomplete
The component wraps the [@geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete) library into a React component. The library uses [Geoapify Geocoding Autocomplete](https://www.geoapify.com/address-autocomplete/) as an address search service.

## Geoapify Geocoding Autocomplete API
The component uses Geoapify Geocoding API for address search.

* [Register and get Geoapify API key](https://myprojects.geoapify.com)
* [Geoapify Location Platform](https://www.geoapify.com/)

## Geoapify Place Details API
On user select events the Place Details API is called to provide more details for the selected place and it's geometry.
Note, that the Place Deatils API call costs additional "Geocoding & Places" request. Use the `skipDetails` option to skip the Places Details API call.

2. Add Geoapify context and provide an apiKey there
3. Add Geoapify Geocoder Autocomplete component

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { GeoapifyGeocoderAutocomplete, GeoapifyContext } from '@geoapify/react-geocoder-autocomplete'
import '@geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete/styles/minimal.css'

const App = () => {
  ...

  function onPlaceSelect(value) {
    console.log(value);
  }

  function onSuggectionChange(value) {
    console.log(value);
  }

  function preprocessHook(value) {
    return `${value}, Munich, Germany`
  }

  function postprocessHook(feature) {
    return feature.properties.street;
  }

  function suggestionsFilter(suggestions) {
    const processedStreets = [];

    const filtered = suggestions.filter(value => {
      if (!value.properties.street || processedStreets.indexOf(value.properties.street) >= 0) {
        return false;
      } else {
        processedStreets.push(value.properties.street);
        return true;
      }
    })

    return filtered;
  }

  return <GeoapifyContext apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE">

### Component event properties
| Name | Description | Value type |
|-|-|-|
| placeSelect | Fired when a location was selected | [GeoJSON.Feature](https://geojson.org/) |
| suggestionsChange | Fired on new suggestions | [GeoJSON.Feature[]](https://geojson.org/) |

Learn more about Geocoder result properties on [Geoapify Documentation page](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/geocoding/).

The component doesn't have dependancy on [@types/geojson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/geojson). However, you can install it to work with GeoJSON types.

### Hooks and filters
| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| preprocessingHook | Modify the text to search. For example, if you expect that the user enters a street name you can add a city or postcode to search streets in the city. |
| postprocessingHook | Modify the text that will be displayed in the input field and suggestions list. For example, you can show only a street name. |
